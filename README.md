Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method that is
used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets. So, we need to change a large
set of variables into a smaller one. This has to be done in a way that it still contains
most of the necessary information.The main idea of PCA is reducing the number
of variables of a data set by ranking the principal components with the amount
of variance captured, and selecting the top components allows for dimensionality
reduction with minimal loss of information.


In this research, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was the primary approach to
developing a face recognition system. The algorithm showed encouraging results in
correctly recognizing faces from a dataset of photos taken in various lighting, position,
and occlusion scenarios. Our research revealed that PCA successfully preserved
important information while reducing the dimensionality of the face picture data.
This dimensionality reduction made computations faster and increased recognition
process efficiency.
Additionally, by using PCA, we could recognize and extract the essential elements
from the facial photos, which improved the system’s ability to operate reliably and
generalize to new faces. Even though the accuracy rates of our face recognition
technology are satisfactory, there is still room for improvement. To improve the
system’s performance, for example, investigating deep learning-based methods and
other sophisticated machine learning techniques may be beneficial, especially when
handling larger datasets and more challenging scenarios.
Overall, this effort advances our knowledge of and ability to use PCA in face
recognition, showcasing how useful it is for creating dependable and successful
recognition systems. Our project offers a strong basis for future research and development
efforts aimed at enhancing the capabilities of face recognition systems as the technology 
in this area continues to progress.
